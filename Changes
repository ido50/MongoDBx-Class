Revision history for MongoDBx::Class

{{$NEXT}}
	- MongoDBx::Class's connect() method now takes all the parameters
	  that MongoDB::Collection's new() method takes, so we can use
	  authentication and other MongoDB options. We can also define a
	  safe connection with the 'safe' option.

	- DateTime inflation/deflation in MongoDBx::Class::ParsedAttribute::DateTime
	  is now evaled to prevent dies
	- The argumented version of the update() method in MongoDBx::Class::Moose
	  now also updates the document object with the new changes
	- Updated test to reflect above change
	- Fixed bug causing 'null' values being saved in the database when
	  using the $doc->update() method.
