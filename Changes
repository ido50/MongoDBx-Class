Revision history for MongoDBx::Class

{{$NEXT}}

0.7       2011-03-17 00:48:50 Asia/Jerusalem
	- Changed the way database connection is made to be more like
	  in the original MongoDB driver (there was no reason to do it differently,
	  this change breaks backwords compatibility though)
	- Added the defines_many relationship type that helps embedding
	  documents within a hash reference.
	- Added the as_hashref() method to embedded documents.
	- Removed the -T option from the shebang line in 01-simple.t as
	  it seems like it causes the whole module finding problems (though
	  I could be wrong)
	- Status updated from alpha to beta

0.6       2011-02-01 23:28:29 Asia/Jerusalem
	- MongoDBx::Class's connect() method now takes all the parameters
	  that MongoDB::Collection's new() method takes, so we can use
	  authentication and other MongoDB options. We can also define a
	  safe connection with the 'safe' option.

0.5       2011-02-01 21:10:25 Asia/Jerusalem
	- DateTime inflation/deflation in MongoDBx::Class::ParsedAttribute::DateTime
	  is now evaled to prevent dies
	- The argumented version of the update() method in MongoDBx::Class::Moose
	  now also updates the document object with the new changes
	- Updated test to reflect above change
	- Fixed bug causing 'null' values being saved in the database when
	  using the $doc->update() method.

0.4       2011-01-11 22:25:54 Asia/Jerusalem
	- Added the _attributes method to document objects (standalone/embedded)
	- Added the ParsedAttribute role and the ParsedAttribute::DateTime class for
	      document attributes that are automatically expanded and collapsed by MongoDBx::Class
	- Added the Parsed attribute trait to allow setting document attributes
	      that are parsed by ParsedAttribute classes
	- Fixed some POD mistakes in the docs
	- Improved the documentation a bit
	- insert and batch_insert shouldn't enforce only inserting hash-refs
	- Fixed bug in MongoDBx::Class::Collection->update where the wrong function argument was collapsed
	- Fixed bug in MongoDBx::Class::Collection->find_one where searching by string OID didn't work
	- Updated test suite with new features

0.3       2010-12-26 12:15:03 Asia/Jerusalem
	- Fixed typos, errors and mistakes in the distribution's documentation
	- Added another item to the CAVEATS AND THINGS TO CONSIDER section of MongoDBx/Class.pm
	- Temporarily added a bypass for the test problem until I can figure
	  out what's the problem.

0.2       2010-12-25 23:13:25 Asia/Jerusalem
	- Fixed bug preventing tests from loading the test schema
