In L<MongoDBx::Class>, references are expected to be in the DBRef format,

	{ "$ref": "collection_name", "$id": ObjectId("4cbca90d3a41e35916720100") }

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

Aside from attributes provided by L<MongoDBx::Class::EmbeddedDocument>,
the following attributes are provided:

=head2 ref_coll

A string representing the collection in which the reference document is
stored (translates to the '$ref' hash key above).

=head2 ref_id

A L<MongoDB::OID> object with the internal ID of the referenced document
(translates to the '$id' hash key above).

=cut

has 'ref_coll' => (is => 'ro', isa => 'Str', required => 1);

has 'ref_id' => (is => 'ro', isa => 'MongoDB::OID', required => 1);

=head1 METHODS

Aside from methods provided by L<MongoDBx::Class::EmbeddedDocument>,
the following methods are provided:

=head2 load()
